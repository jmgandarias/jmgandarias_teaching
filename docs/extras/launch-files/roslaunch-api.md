# Using the ROS Launch Python API 

!!! success "COM2009 Assignment #1 Checkpoint"
    It helps if you've already completed Assignment #1 [up to and including all of **Part 3**](../../com2009/assignment1/part3.md) before working on this.

The *ROS Launch Python API* allows us to launch nodes (and other launch files) from inside our own nodes! [The official documentation for the ROS Launch API](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/API%20Usage) is the best place to go to find out how to use this, but here's a quick example, if you're short on time. 

Within the `tuos_examples` package there is a node called `pointless_file_generator`.

!!! tip
    You may need to [update your local copy of the course repo](../tuos-ros.md#updating) to ensure that you have this!

This node takes a file path as a command-line argument, and writes a text file of the same name to the file system. From the command line, you can call the node like this:

```bash
rosrun tuos_examples pointless_file_generator -f FILENAME
```

A text file called `FILENAME.txt` will be saved to your current working directory.

* Use the `#!sh pwd` to determine your current working directory,
* Use the `#!sh ls` command to show the files/directories present at this file system location, 
* Then, use the `#!sh cat` command to display the content of the `FILENAME.txt` file, e.g.:
    
    ```bash
    cat FILENAME.txt
    ```

Suppose you wanted to call this node programmatically instead (i.e. from within another Python Node). Below is an example of a very simple ROS node that does just that. Once the code below is executed it will launch the `pointless_file_generator` node from the `tuos_examples` package, but this time using the ROS Launch API. The key difference here is that instead of `FILENAME`, we need to define a **full path** to the text file that we want to generate.

```python title="roslaunch_api_example.py"
--8<-- "snippets/roslaunch_api_example.py"
```

Create a node in one of your own ROS packages and then copy and paste the above code into it. You'll need to update the `#!py file_path = "/full/path/to/text/file"` line to represent the path to a **real** location on your file system. The file will be then created automatically by the node in the specified location. You must specify a **full file system path** in order for this to work correctly using the ROS Launch Python API though, and you will only be able to write to a location that's within your Home directory (e.g.: `#!py /home/student/path/to/file`), otherwise you'll get an error!

## Assignment #2 Hint: Saving a SLAM Map Programmatically 

In [the SLAM Exercise in Assignment #1 Part 3](../../com2009/assignment1/part3.md#ex2) we run SLAM in the background while driving our Waffle around a simulated environment manually, using the `turtlebot3_teleop` node. Once SLAM has generated a full map we use a `rosrun` command (in the terminal) to call a `map_saver` node to save a copy of this map for us: 

```bash
rosrun map_server map_saver -f {map name}
```

You can therefore use *exactly the same approach* as in the example above to achieve this *programmatically*!

Wrap this into one of your own Task 4 ROS nodes, or build a standalone node inside your team's ROS package to call the `map_saver` node when required. Perhaps you could even wrap the relevant lines of code from the above example inside a while loop and get the node to update a map file at regular intervals (say every 5 seconds?) while your robot explores its environment...

!!! warning

    1. When calling the `map_saver` node you may actually find that it **must** be wrapped within a loop in order for the process to work reliably.
    1. **Don't** call the `map_saver` node too regularly though (i.e. no more than once every few seconds **at most**), otherwise you'll swamp the ROS network which can result in the system becoming unstable and the robot becoming unresponsive.
