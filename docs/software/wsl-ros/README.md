# The WSL-ROS Simulation Environment

To support these courses we've created a custom ROS (Noetic) and Ubuntu (20.04) environment which runs on Windows 10 using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/). We call this "**WSL-ROS**," and you can find out more about it - and how to use it - here:

* [Installing WSL-ROS on your Own Machine](./install.md)
* [Accessing WSL-ROS from A University Managed Desktop Computer on Campus](./on-campus.md)
* **Further Support**: [Using WSL-ROS on the University Managed Desktops](../on-campus/getting-started.md)
