title: Submitting Your ROS Package for Part A
---

Follow [the instructions here](../submission.md) for preparing your ROS package for submission.

In addition to the 30 marks available for Task 1 & 2, there are **a further 10 marks** available in Part A for making an *'out-of-the-box' submission*.

## An 'Out-of-the-Box' Submission

You will be awarded the **full 10 marks** if:

* You prepare your ROS package correctly, as per [the instructions here](../submission.md).
* Your package follows the ["Key Requirements" specified here](../README.md#your-ros-package).
* Your package contains correctly defined launch files for each of the tasks: `task1.launch` & `task2.launch`.
* The package can be successfully deployed on one of the Robotics Laptops (via the launch files, as above) without any intervention from the teaching team.

## Resubmission for Part A

If the package that your team submit for Part A is *not* deployable on the first submission then you'll have an opportunity to resubmit this in the weeks following the submission deadline. **You will receive 0/10 marks** for an 'out-of-the-box' submission, but this will at least give you the opportunity to see what went wrong, and for your team to still pick up the remaining 30 marks that are available for Tasks 1 & 2. 

!!! warning 
    We will be offering a resubmission opportunity for **Part A ONLY**. There **won't** be a re-submission opportunity for Part B, so get it right the second time to avoid missing out on the remaining 60 marks for Assignment #2.
