## Introduction

:material-pen: **Exercises**: 8  
:material-timer: **Estimated Completion Time**: 2 hours

### Aims

In the first part of this lab course you will learn the basics of ROS and become familiar with some key tools and principles of the framework which will allow you to program robots and work with ROS applications effectively.  For the most part, you will interact with ROS using the *Linux command line* and so you will also become familiar with some key Linux command line tools that will help you.  Finally, you will learn how to create some basic ROS Nodes using Python and get a taste of how ROS topics and messages work.

### Intended Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session you will be able to:  

1. Control a TurtleBot3 Robot, in simulation, using ROS.
1. Launch ROS applications using `roslaunch` and `rosrun`.
1. Interrogate running ROS applications using key ROS command line tools.
1. Create a ROS package comprised of multiple nodes and program these nodes (in Python) to communicate with one another using ROS Communication Methods.
1. Navigate a Linux filesystem and learn how to do various filesystem operations from within a Linux Terminal.

## First Steps

**Step 1: Accessing A ROS Environment for this Course**

If you haven't done so already, see here for all the details on [how to install or access a ROS environment for this course](../../software/README.md).

**Step 2: Launch ROS**

Launch your ROS environment.

1. If you're using WSL-ROS on a university managed desktop machine then follow [the instructions here to launch it](../../software/on-campus/getting-started.md).
1. If you're [running WSL-ROS on your own machine](../../software/wsl-ros/install.md), then you'll need to launch the Windows Terminal to access a WSL-ROS terminal instance.
1. If you opted for [a manual install option](../../software/manual/README.md), then we trust that you know what you're doing already :material-emoticon-wink-outline:.

Either way, you should now have access to a Linux terminal instance, and we'll refer to this terminal instance as **TERMINAL 1**.

**Step 3: Download The Course Repo**

<a name="course-repo"></a>

We've put together a few ROS packages of our own that you'll use throughout this course. These all live within [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/tom-howard/tuos_ros), and you'll need to download and install this into your ROS environment now, before going any further.

1. In **TERMINAL 1**, navigate to a folder called the *"Catkin Workspace."* We'll talk more about this later on but, for now, just run the following command:

    ```bash
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
    ```

1. Then, run the following command to clone the Course Repo from GitHub:


    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tom-howard/tuos_ros.git
    ```
    ***

1. Once this is done, you'll need to compile everything:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    catkin build && source ~/.bashrc
    ```
    ***

    Don't worry too much about what you just did, for now. We'll cover this in more detail throughout the course. That's it for now though, we'll start using some of the packages that we've just installed a bit later on...

#### :material-pen: Exercise 1: Launching a simulation and making a ROS robot move {#ex1}

Now that you're all up and running, let's launch ROS and fire up a simulation of our robot... 

1. In the terminal enter the following command to launch a simulation of a TurtleBot3 Waffle in an empty world:  
        
    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:** 
    ```bash
    roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch
    ```    
    ***

1. A Gazebo simulation window should open and within this you should see a TurtleBot3 Waffle (very similar to [our real robots](../../about/robots.md)):

    <figure markdown>
      ![](../../images/gazebo/tb3_empty_world.png){width=800}
    </figure>

1. With your Gazebo Simulation up and running, return to your terminal and open up a *second* terminal instance (**TERMINAL 2**). In the Windows Terminal (for instance) you can press the *New Tab* button: 
    
    <figure markdown>
      ![](../../images/wsl/wt_new_tab.svg)
    </figure>

    (or press the ++ctrl+shift+t++ keyboard shortcut).
    
1. In the new terminal instance enter the following command:<a name="teleop"></a>

    ***
    **TERMINAL 2:**
    ```bash
    rosrun turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key
    ```
    ***

1. Follow the instructions provided in the terminal to drive the robot around using specific buttons on your keyboard:

    <figure markdown>
      ![](../../images/ros-cli/teleop_keymap.svg)
    </figure>

##### Summary

You have just launched a number of different applications on a ROS Network using two different ROS commands - `roslaunch` and `rosrun`: 

1. `roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch`
1. `rosrun turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key`

These two commands have a similar structure, but work slightly differently. 

The first command you used was a `roslaunch` command, which has the following two parts to it (after the `roslaunch` bit):

``` { .bash .no-copy }
roslaunch {[1] Package name} {[2] Launch file}
```

**Part [1]** specifies the name of the *ROS package* containing the functionality that we want to execute. **Part [2]** is a file within that package that tells ROS exactly what scripts (*'nodes'*) that we want to launch. We can launch multiple nodes at the same time from a single launch file.

The second command was a `rosrun` command, which has a structure similar to `roslaunch`:

``` { .bash .no-copy }
rosrun {[1] Package name} {[2] Node name}
```    

Here, **Part [1]** is the same as the `roslaunch` command, but **Part [2]** is slightly different: `{[2] Node name}`. Here we are directly specifying a single script that we want to execute. We therefore use `rosrun` if we only want to launch a **single node** on the ROS network (`turtlebot3_teleop_key` in this case, which is a Python script).

## Packages & Nodes

### ROS Packages {#packages}

ROS applications are organised into *packages*. Packages are basically folders containing scripts, configurations and launch files (ways to launch those scripts and configurations), all of which relate to some common robot functionality. ROS uses packages as a way to organise all the programs running on a robot. 

!!! info  
    The package system is a fundamental concept in ROS and all ROS programs are organised in this way.

You will create a number of packages throughout this course, each containing different nodes, launch files and other things too. We'll start to explore this later on in this part of the course.

### ROS Nodes {#nodes}

ROS *Nodes* are executable programs that perform specific robot tasks and operations. Earlier on we used `rosrun` to launch a node called `turtlebot3_teleop_key`, which allowed us to remotely control (or "teleoperate") the robot, for example. 

!!! question
    What was the name of the ROS *package* that contained the `turtlebot3_teleop_key` node? (Remember: `rosrun {[1] Package name} {[2] Node name}`)

A ROS Robot might have hundreds of individual nodes running simultaneously to carry out all its necessary operations and actions. Each node runs independently, but uses *ROS communication methods* to communicate and share data with the other nodes on the ROS Network.

## The ROS Network

We can use the `rosnode` **ROS command** to view all the nodes that are currently active on a ROS Network.

#### :material-pen: Exercise 2: Visualising the ROS Network {#ex2}

You should currently have two terminal windows active: the first in which you launched the Gazebo simulation (**TERMINAL 1**) and the second with your `turtlebot3_teleop_key` node active (**TERMINAL 2**).

1. Open up a new terminal instance now (**TERMINAL 3**).
1. Use the following command to have a look at which nodes are currently active on the network:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 3:**
    ```bash
    rosnode list
    ```
    ***

    Only a handful of nodes should be listed:

    ``` { .bash .no-copy }
    /gazebo
    /gazebo_gui
    /rosout
    /turtlebot3_teleop_keyboard
    ```

1. We can visualise the connections between the active nodes by using the `rqt_graph` node within the `rqt_graph` package. We can use `rosrun` to launch this node directly (you might see some error messages when you do this, but don't worry about them):

    ***
    **TERMINAL 3:**
    ```bash
    rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph
    ```
    ***

    A new window should then open, displaying something similar to the following (hover over the diagram to enable colour highlighting):

    <figure markdown>
      ![A visualisation of all the ROS nodes active on the system and the flow of information between them](../../images/rqt/graph.png)
    </figure>

    This tool shows us that the `/turtlebot3_teleop_keyboard` and `/gazebo` nodes are communicating with one another. The direction of the arrow tells us that the `/turtlebot3_teleop_keyboard` node is a *Publisher* and the `/gazebo` node is a *Subscriber*. The two nodes communicate via a **ROS Topic**, in this case the `/cmd_vel` topic, and on this topic the `/turtlebot3_teleop_keyboard` node publishes **messages**.

## Publishers and Subscribers: A *ROS Communication Method* 

ROS Topics are key to making things happen on a robot. Nodes can publish (*write*) and/or subscribe to (*read*) ROS Topics in order to share data around the ROS network. Data is published to topics using *ROS Messages*. We were actually publishing messages to a topic when we made the robot move using the `turtlebot3_teleop_key` node previously.

Let's have a look at this in a bit more detail...

#### :material-pen: Exercise 3: Exploring ROS Topics and Messages {#ex3}

We can find out more about the `/cmd_vel` topic by using the `rostopic` **ROS command**.

1. Open up yet another new terminal instance (**TERMINAL 4**) and type the following:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 4:**
    ```bash
    rostopic info /cmd_vel
    ```
    ***

    This should provide an output similar to the following:
    
    ``` { .bash .no-copy }
    Type: geometry_msgs/Twist

    Publishers:
        * /turtlebot3_teleop_keyboard (http://localhost:#####/)

    Subscribers:
        * /gazebo (http://localhost:#####/)
    ```

    This confirms what we discovered earlier about the publisher(s) and subscriber(s) to the `/cmd_vel` topic.  In addition, this also tells us the topic *type*, or the *type of message* that is being published on this topic.

    Overall, the output above tells us the following:
    
    1. The `/turtlebot3_teleop_keyboard` node is currently publishing (i.e. writing data) to the `/cmd_vel` topic, confirming what we saw from the `rqt_graph` node before.
    1. The `/gazebo` node is subscribing to the topic. This node is the Gazebo application that's running the simulation of the robot. The node therefore monitors (i.e. *subscribes* to) the `/cmd_vel` topic and makes the robot move in the simulator whenever a velocity command is published.
    1. The *type* of message used by the `/cmd_vel` topic is called: `geometry_msgs/Twist`. 
    
        The message type has two parts: `geometry_msgs` and `Twist`. `geometry_msgs` is the name of the ROS package that this message belongs to and `Twist` is the actual message *type*. 

        We have just learnt then, that if we want to make the robot move we need to publish `Twist` messages to the `/cmd_vel` topic.

1. We can use the `rosmsg` **ROS command** to provide further information about this message, or any other message that we may be interested in:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 4:**
    ```bash
    rosmsg info geometry_msgs/Twist
    ```
    ***

    From this, we should obtain the following:

    ``` { .txt .no-copy }
    geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear
      float64 x
      float64 y
      float64 z
    geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular
      float64 x
      float64 y
      float64 z
    ```

    We'll learn more about what this means in Part 2.

1. To finish, enter ++ctrl+c++ in each of the three terminals that should currently have ROS processes running (Terminals **1**, **2** and **3**). The associated Gazebo and RQT Graph windows should close as a result of this too.

!!! tip
    Whenever you need to stop any ROS process use ++ctrl+c++ in the terminal it's running in.

## Creating Your First ROS Applications

#### :material-pen: Exercise 4: Creating your own ROS Package {#ex4}

In a minute or two you will create some simple publisher and subscriber nodes in Python and send messages between them. As we learnt earlier though, ROS applications must be created within packages, and so we need to create a package first in order to start creating our own ROS nodes. 

ROS provides a tool to create a new ROS package and ensure that all the essential elements are present: `catkin_create_pkg`.

It's important to work in a specific filesystem location when we create and work on our own ROS packages, so that ROS can access and build everything appropriately. These spaces are called *"Catkin Workspaces"* and one has already been created in the WSL-ROS environment, called `catkin_ws`[^why_catkin]:

``` { .bash .no-copy }
/home/student/catkin_ws/
```
Or:
``` { .bash .no-copy }
~/catkin_ws/
```

!!! note 
    `~` is an alias for your home directory. So `cd ~/catkin_ws/` is the same as typing `cd /home/student/catkin_ws/` (in WSL-ROS, the default user is `student`).

[^why_catkin]: "The name catkin comes from the tail-shaped flower cluster found on willow trees -- a reference to Willow Garage where catkin was created." (According to [ROS.org](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/conceptual_overview#Overview)) 

1. Navigate to the `catkin_ws` folder by using the Linux `cd` command (**c**hange **d**irectory). In **TERMINAL 1** enter the following:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/catkin_ws/
    ```
    ***

1. Inside the catkin workspace there is a directory called `src`. All new packages need to be located in the `src` folder, so we need to be here when we use the `catkin_create_pkg` tool to create a new package. So, use the `cd` command again to navigate into the `catkin_ws/src` folder:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    cd src
    ```
    ***

1. Now, use the `catkin_create_pkg` script to create a new package called `part1_pubsub`, and define `rospy` and `std_msgs` as dependencies:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    catkin_create_pkg part1_pubsub rospy std_msgs
    ```
    ***

    !!! question
        What did the `catkin_create_pkg` tool just do? (**Hint**: there were *four* things, and it will have told you about them!)
    
1. Navigate into this new package directory.

1. `ls` is a **Linux command** which *lists* the contents of the current directory. Use `ls` to list the content of the `part1_pubsub` directory, as created by the `catkin_create_pkg` tool.

    Catkin packages are typically organised in the following way, and have a few essential features that **must** be present in order for the package to be valid:

    ``` { .txt .no-copy }
    package_folder/    -- All packages must be self-contained within their 
      |                   own root folder [essential]
      |-launch/        -- A folder for launch files (optional)
      |-src/           -- A folder for source files (python scripts etc)
      |-CMakeLists.txt -- Rules for compiling the package [essential]
      `-package.xml    -- Information about the package [essential]
    ```

    You will have noticed that the `catkin_create_pkg` tool made sure that the essential features of a Catkin Package were created when we asked it to build the `part1_pubsub` package above.

1. Before we do anything else, it's good practice to now run `CMake` on the package (using `catkin build`) to register it on our ROS system and make sure there are no errors with its definition so far:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    catkin build part1_pubsub
    ```
    ***

1. Finally, "re-source" your environment[^source-bashrc] using the following command:

    ***
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
    ***

    ... and you're good to go.

    !!! warning
        You will need run `#!bash source ~/.bashrc` in any other terminals that you have open too, in order for the changes to propagate through to these as well!
    
[^source-bashrc]: What does `source ~/.bashrc` do? [See here for an explanation](https://devconnected.com/source-command-on-linux-explained/#Source_to_update_your_current_shell_environment_bashrc).

#### :material-pen: Exercise 5: Creating a publisher node {#ex5}

1. Within your `part1_pubsub` package directory, navigate to the `src` folder using the `cd` command.
1. `touch` is a **Linux command** that we can use to create an empty file. Use this to create an empty file called `publisher.py`, which we will add content to shortly:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    touch publisher.py
    ```
    ***

1. Use `ls` to verify that the file has been created, but use the `-l` option with this, so that the command provides its output in *"a long listing format"*:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    ls -l
    ```
    ***

    This should output something similar to the following:

    ``` { .txt .no-copy }
    total 0
    -rw-r--r-- 1 student student 0 MMM DD HH:MM publisher.py
    ```

    This confirms that the file exists, and the `0` in the middle of the bottom line there indicates that the file is empty (i.e. its current size is 0 bytes), which is what we'd expect.

1. We therefore now need to open the file and add content to it. We'll be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as our IDE for this course. Launch VS Code now using the following command in **TERMINAL 1**:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    code ~
    ```
    ***

    !!! warning "WSL Users..."
        
        It's important to launch VS Code within your ROS environment using the "WSL" extension. [Always remember to check for this](../../software/on-campus/vscode.md#verify).

1. Using the VS Code File Explorer, navigate to your `part1_pubsub` package directory (`~/catkin_ws/src/part1_pubsub/`), locate the `publisher.py` file that you have just created in the `/part1_pubsub/src/` folder and click on the file to open it. 

1. Once opened, copy [the code provided here](./part1/publisher.md) into the empty file and save it. <a name="ex5_ret"></a>
    
    !!! note
        It's important that you understand how this code works, so make sure that you **read the annotations**!
    
1. **Make sure that you've saved the `publisher.py` file (in VS Code) before trying to run it!**
    
    Do this by using the ++ctrl+s++ keyboard shortcut, or going to `File > Save` from the menu at the top of the VS Code screen.

1. We can now run this node using the `rosrun` **ROS command**. However, because we closed everything down earlier on, the *ROS Master* is no longer active. First then, we need to re-launch it manually using `roscore`:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    roscore
    ```
    ***

1. Then, in **TERMINAL 2**, use `rosrun` to execute the `publisher.py` script that you have just created by providing the relevant information to the `rosrun` command. Remember: `rosrun {package name} {script name}`, so:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 2:**
    ```bash
    rosrun part1_pubsub publisher.py
    ```
    ***

    ... Hmmm, something not quite right? If you typed the command exactly as above and then tried to run it, you probably just received the following error:

    ``` { .txt .no-copy }
    [rosrun] Couldn't find executable named publisher.py below /home/student/catkin_ws/src/part1_pubsub
    [rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,
    [rosrun] or not executable:
    [rosrun]   /home/student/catkin_ws/src/part1_pubsub/src/publisher.py
    ``` 

    The clue there is the word *"executable"*. When we create a file, using `touch` it is given certain *permissions*. Run `ls -l` again (making sure that your terminal is in the right location: `~/catkin_ws/src/part1_pubsub/src/`).
        
    The first bit tells us about the permissions that are currently set: `-rw-r--r--`. This tells us *who* has permission to do *what* with this file and (currently) the first bit: `-rw-`, tells us that we (as the user `student`) have permission to **R**ead or **W**rite to it. There is a *third* option we can set too though, which is the *execute* permission, and we can set this using the `chmod` **Linux command**...

1. Run the `chmod` command as follows:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 2:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x publisher.py
    ```
    ***

1. Now, run `ls -l` again to see what has changed:
    
    ***
    **TERMINAL 2:**
    ```bash
    ls -l
    ```
    ***

    We have now granted permission for the file to be e**X**ecuted too:
    
    ``` { .txt .no-copy }
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 student student 1557 MMM DD HH:MM publisher.py
    ```

1. OK, now use `rosrun` again to (*hopefully!*) run the `publisher.py` node (remember: `rosrun {package name} {script name}`).
    
    If you see a message in the terminal similar to the following then the node has been launched successfully:
        
    ``` { .txt .no-copy }
    [INFO] [#####]: The 'simple_publisher' node is active...
    ```

    Phew!

1. We can further verify that our publisher node is running using a number of different tools. Try running the following commands in **TERMINAL 3**:

    1. `rosnode list`: This will provide a list of all the nodes that are currently active on the system. Verify that the name of our publisher node is visible in this list.
    1. `rostopic list`: This will provide a list of the topics that are currently being used by nodes on the system. Verify that the name of the topic that our publisher is publishing messages to is present within this list.

!!! danger "Using WSL-ROS on the University Managed Desktops?"

    **Remember**: [any work that you do in the WSL-ROS environment on campus machines will not be preserved automatically](../../software/on-campus/getting-started.md#backing-up-and-restoring-your-data). You should therefore backup your work to your University `U:\` drive regularly to avoid losing anything. To do this, run the following command in any WSL-ROS terminal instance:

    ``` bash
    wsl_ros backup
    ```

#### Using the `rostopic` command {#rostopic}

So far we have used the `rostopic` ROS command with two additional arguments:

* `list`: to provide us with a *list* of all the topics that are active on our ROS system, and
* `info`: to provide us with *information* on a particular topic of interest.

We can use the *autocomplete functionality* of the Linux terminal to provide us with a list of *all* the available options that we can use with the `rostopic` command.  To do this you can type `rostopic` followed by a ++space++ and then press the ++tab++ key twice:

``` { .bash .no-copy }
rostopic[SPACE][TAB][TAB]
```

You should then be presented with a list of the available arguments for the `rostopic` command:

<figure markdown>
  ![](../../images/ros-cli/rostopic_autocomplete.gif)
</figure>

* `rostopic hz {topic name}` provides information on the frequency (in Hz) at which messages are being published to a topic:

    ```bash
    rostopic hz /chatter
    ```

    This should tell us that our publisher node is publishing messages to the `/chatter` topic at (or close to) 10 Hz, which is exactly what we ask for in the `publisher.py` file (in the `__init__` part of our `Publisher` class). Enter ++ctrl+c++ to stop this command.

* `rostopic echo {topic name}` shows the messages being published to a topic:

    ```bash
    rostopic echo /chatter
    ```

    This will provide a live stream of the messages that our `publisher.py` node is publishing to the `/chatter` topic. Enter ++ctrl+c++ to stop this.

* We can see some additional options for this command by viewing the help documentation:

    ```bash
    rostopic echo -h
    ```

    From here, for instance, we can learn that if we just wanted the echo command to display a set number of messages from the `/chatter` topic we could use the `-n` option. To display the most recent two messages only, for example:

    ```bash
    rostopic echo /chatter -n2
    ```

#### :material-pen: Exercise 6: Creating a subscriber node {#ex6}

You will now create another node to *subscribe* to the topic that our publisher node is broadcasting messages to, to illustrate how information can be passed from one node to another, via topic messages.

1. In **TERMINAL 3** use the filesystem commands that were introduced earlier (`cd`, `ls` and `roscd`) to navigate to the `src` folder of your `part1_pubsub` package.
1. Use the same procedure as before to create a new empty Python file called `subscriber.py` and remember to make it executable! <a name="ex6_ret"></a>
1. Then, open the newly created `subscriber.py` file in VS Code, paste in [the code here](./part1/subscriber.md) and save it. Once again, it's important that you understand how this code works, so **make sure you read the code annotations**! 

1. Use `rosrun` to execute your newly created `subscriber.py` node (remember: `rosrun {package name} {script name}`). If your publisher and subscriber nodes are working correctly you should see an output like this:
    
    <figure markdown>
      ![](part1/subscriber_output.gif)

1. As before, we can find out what nodes are running on our system by using the `rosnode list` command. Run this in **TERMINAL 4** and see if you can identify the nodes that you have just launched.

1. Finally, close down your publisher and subscriber nodes and the ROS Master by entering ++ctrl+c++ in Terminals 1, 2 and 3.

**Advanced**: <a name="pubsub_plus"></a> 

You've now created a publisher and subscriber, both of which were able to communicate with one another over the `/chatter` topic, using the `String` *standard* ROS message type. This message is provided, by ROS, as part of the `std_msgs` package, but there are other simple message types within this package that we can use too to pass data around a ROS network too, one of which is `Float64`.

* How could you adapt your publisher and subscriber nodes to use the `Float64` message type, instead of `String`?

## Launch Files

At the beginning of this session we launched the Gazebo Simulation of our robot using a *launch file* and the `roslaunch` command. This provides a means to launch multiple ROS nodes *simultaneously*, and we will demonstrate this by building a launch file for the publisher and subscriber nodes that we created in the previous exercises. Launch files must be located within a package, so first let's have a look at a package that already exists, and explore the launch file within it.

#### :material-pen: Exercise 7: Exploring a ROS Package and Launch File {#ex7}

We launched the `turtlebot3_teleop_key` node earlier using `rosrun`, but there's also a way to launch this using a launch file. To investigate this, we need to look inside the package within which the `turtlebot3_teleop_key` node exists.

1. We launched the `turtlebot3_teleop_key` node with `rosrun` as follows: `rosrun turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key`, which means that the node is located within a package called `turtlebot3_teleop`. `roscd` is a **ROS command** that allows us to navigate to the directory of any ROS package installed on our system, without us needing to know the path to the package beforehand.

1. In **TERMINAL 3** use the `roscd` command to navigate to the `turtlebot3_teleop` package directory on the Linux filesystem:
  
    ***
    **TERMINAL 3:**
    ```bash
    roscd turtlebot3_teleop
    ```
    ***

    The terminal prompt should have changed to illustrate where on the filesystem the `roscd` command has just taken you:
    
    <figure markdown>
      ![](../../images/ros-cli/tb3_teleop_dir.svg)
    </figure>

1. `pwd` is a **Linux command** which tells us the current filesystem location of our terminal. Enter this command to confirm what the terminal prompt has told us.
    
    So, now we know *where* the `turtlebot3_teleop` package is located on our machine, and we can then use more Linux commands to explore this further:

1. Use `ls` to list the contents of the `turtlebot3_teleop` package directory. `ls` on its own will simply list the items in the current directory, try this first.

1. Then, use the `-F` option to find out a little more:
    
    ***
    **TERMINAL 3:**
    ```bash
    ls -F
    ```
    ***
    
    You will notice that the output has now changed slightly: items followed by a `/` are folders (aka *"directories"*) and items without the `/` are files (files will often have a file extension too).
    
    !!! question "Questions" 
        1. How many items were there in the `turtlebot3_teleop` package directory?
        1. How many of these were directories and how many were files? 

    *Launch files* for a package should be located in a *launch* folder within the package directory. Did you notice a `launch` folder in the output of the `ls` command above?

1. Use the `cd` command to navigate into the `turtlebot3_teleop` package `launch` folder and then use `ls` again to see what's in there. 

    In this folder you should see a `turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch` file. We'll now have a look at the contents of this file...

1. `cat` is a **Linux command** that we can use to display the contents of a file in the terminal. Use this to display the contents of the `turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch` file.

    ***
    **TERMINAL 3:**
    ```bash
    cat turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
    ```
    ***

    !!! question
        Knowing what you do now, how would you launch the `turtlebot_teleop_key` node using `roslaunch` (instead of `rosrun`)?

##### Summary {#launch_attributes}

From the output of `cat` in the step above you should have noticed that the contents of a launch file are contained within a `<launch>` tag:

```xml
<launch>
  ... 
</launch>
```

Within that, we also have (amongst other things) a `<node>` tag which tells ROS exactly what scripts (*"executables"*) to launch *and* how to launch them:

```xml    
<node pkg="turtlebot3_teleop" type="turtlebot3_teleop_key" name="turtlebot3_teleop_keyboard" output="screen">
</node>
```

The attributes here have the following meaning:

* `pkg`: The name of the *ROS package* containing the functionality that we want to launch.
* `type`: The full name of the script (i.e. *ROS Node*) that we want to execute within that package (including the file extension, if it has one).
* `name`: A descriptive name that we want to give to the ROS node, which will be used to register it on the ROS Network.
* `output`: The place where any output from the node will be printed (either *screen* where the output will be printed to our terminal window, or *log* where the output will be printed to a log file).

#### :material-pen: Exercise 8: Creating a launch file {#ex8}

1. In **TERMINAL 1**, use `roscd` to navigate to the *root* of your `part1_pubsub` package directory.
1. Use the Linux `mkdir` command to **m**a**k**e a new **dir**ectory in the package root folder called `launch`:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    mkdir launch
    ```
    ***

1. Use the `cd` command to enter the `launch` folder that you just created, then use the `touch` command (as before) to create a new empty file called `pubsub.launch`.
1. Open this launch file in VS Code and enter the following text:

    ``` { .xml .no-copy }
    <launch>
      <node pkg={BLANK} type={BLANK} name="pub_node" output="screen">
      </node>
    </launch>
    ```

    <a name="blank-2"></a>

    !!! warning "Fill in the Blanks!"
        Referring to what we learned about [the format of launch files](#launch_attributes) above, replace each `{BLANK}` above with the correct text to launch the publisher node that you created in [Exercise 5](#ex5).
    
1. Use `roslaunch` to launch this file and test it out as it is (remember: `roslaunch {package name} {launch file}`). If everything looks OK then carry on to the next step.
1. The code that we've given you above will launch the `publisher.py` node, but not the `subscriber.py` node.  Add another `<node>` tag to your `pubsub.launch` file to launch the subscriber node as well.
1. The publisher and subscriber nodes and the *ROS Master* can now all be launched with the `roslaunch` command and the `pubsub.launch` file that you have now created.  
1. Launch this in **TERMINAL 1** and then use `rosnode list` in **TERMINAL 2** to check that it all works correctly.

##### Summary {#roslaunch}

* `roslaunch` can be used to launch multiple nodes on a robot from *one single command*.
* It will *also* automatically launch the ROS Master (equivalent to running the `roscore` command manually) if it isn't already running (*did you notice that we didn't have to do this manually in Exercise 8, but we did when we launched our nodes individually, using `rosrun`, in Exercises 6 & 7?*)
* In the `rospy.init(...)` functions of our `publisher.py` and `subscriber.py` Python scripts, we defined a node name and set `anonymous=True`. As a result, when we launched our nodes manually using `rosrun`, the names we defined were honoured, but were appended with a unique combination of numbers.
* When we launched our nodes using `roslaunch` however, the node names were set according to what we had defined in the `name` field of the `<node>` tag within the launch file, and anything specified within the `rospy.init(...)` functions of our Python scripts were overwritten as a result.

## Wrapping Up

In this session we've learnt about some key concepts in ROS, such as Packages; Launch files; Nodes and the *Publisher-Subscriber Communication Method* using Topics and Messages.

We've learnt how to use some key ROS commands:  

* `roslaunch`: to launch multiple ROS Nodes via launch files.
* `roscd`: to navigate to installed ROS packages using a package name alone.
* `rosnode`: to display information about active ROS Nodes.
* `rosrun`: to run executables within a ROS package.
* `rostopic`: to display information about *active* ROS topics.
* `rosmsg`: to display information about *all* ROS messages that are available to use in a ROS application.
* `roscore`: to launch the *ROS Master*: The baseline nodes and programs that are required for ROS to function.

In addition to this we've also learnt how to use `catkin_create_pkg`, which is a helper script for creating ROS package templates.

We have also learnt how to work in the Linux Terminal and navigate a Linux filesystem using key commands such as:

* `pwd`: prints the path of the current working directory to show you which directory you're currently located in.
* `ls`: lists the files in the current directory.
* `cd`: change directory to move around the file system.
* `mkdir`: make a new directory (`mkdir {new_folder}`).
* `cat`: show the contents of a file.
* `chmod`: modify file permissions (i.e. to add execute permissions to a file for all users: `chmod +x {file}`).
* `touch`: create a file without any content.

Finally, we have learnt how to create basic ROS nodes in Python to both *publish* and *subscribe* to ROS topics using standard ROS messages.

### WSL-ROS Managed Desktop Users: Save your work! {#backup}

Remember, the work you have done in the WSL-ROS environment during this session **will not be preserved** for future sessions or across different University machines automatically! To save the work you have done here today you should now run the following script in any idle WSL-ROS Terminal Instance:

```bash
wsl_ros backup
```

This will export your home directory to your University `U:\` Drive, allowing you to restore it on another managed desktop machine the next time you fire up WSL-ROS.
